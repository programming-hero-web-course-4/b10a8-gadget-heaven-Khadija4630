## React Concepts Used

 Components: 

Organize the UI into reusable components to improve code structure and maintainability.

State Management:

 The useState hook in React allows you to store and manage cart and wishlist data.

Props:

 Data flow and communication are achieved by passing data between components via props.

Conditional rendering:

 Display different content depending on the conditions, such as whether an item is in the cart or on the wishlist.

Event Handling: 

Handle user interactions with the UI, such as adding items to the cart or selecting navigation links.

 Routing: 

 Use React Router to manage different pages and routes.

The application stores product data in a JSON file, which is fetched and saved.
